# Covid-19-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-
Hello Everyone, In this repository I have done a detailed data analysis of Covid-19 data as of 1 Sept 2021. I have also created a linear regression model predicting the death of people using individual States death data. I have also created streamlit data explorer application. Feel free to contribute.

Here is the streamlit link to the Dashboard: https://share.streamlit.io/vinamraguptaa/covid-19-exploratory-data-analysis-/main/Covid-19_streamlit.py
