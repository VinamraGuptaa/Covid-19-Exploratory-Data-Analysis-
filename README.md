# Covid-19-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-
Greetings Everyone, In this repository I have done a detailed data analysis of Covid-19 data as of 1 Sept 2021. I have also created a linear regression model predicting the death of people using individual States death data. I have also created streamlit data explorer application. Feel free to contribute.
